1. GENERAL INFORMATION

3 KENYA METHODIST UNIVERSITY
1.0: ABOUT KENYA METHODIST UNIVERSITY (KeMU)

1.1 Historical Background
Kenya  Methodist  University  (KeMU)  is  a  private  chartered  Christian  university  
founded  by  the  Methodist  Church  in  Kenya  to  foster  the  intellectual,  spiritual,  and  
physical  development  of  individuals  in  society  while  guided  by  Christian  principles.  
Indeed, the history of the University is intertwined with that of the Methodist Church 
in Kenya whose unyielding support and influence has shaped policies and procedures 
of the University, as well as its religious, social, and cultural atmosphere. 
The  establishment  of  the  University  was  the  culmination  of  a  dream  that  had  been  
nurtured by the Methodist Church in pursuance of its holistic Gospel all the way back 
into the 1950s. Back then, cognizant of the increasing population, rising unemployment 
among the youth and poor land use, local church leaders hatched the idea of helping 
people to become self-reliant through training and skills development. 
In 1958, the Kaaga Rural Training Centre was established for the purpose of training 
people and providing skills in agriculture.
In  1980,  this  training  centre  was  converted  into  the  Methodist  Training  Institute  
(MTI), which became a centre for training Ministers for the Methodist Church.
But the actual idea of setting up a university was mooted years later during the Annual 
MCK  Conference  held  at  Shanzu  Teachers  College,  Mombasa  in  1986  and  the  
following year (in 1987) a working party was established to determine its feasibility. 
In 1991, the Trust Deed for the establishment of the proposed University was drawn 
up and in the same year, staffing, a start-up curriculum, library development and 
financial development plans were developed. These were later presented to the then 
Commission for Higher Education and in 1992 the draft proposal was completed and 
approved by the Commission. 
In 1997, Kenya Methodist University (KeMU) was formally established and granted a 
Letter of Interim Authority by the Commission for Higher Education. 
Nine years later, in July 2006, the culmination of years of hard work and a crowning 
achievement  of  the  dreams  of  its  founders  resulted  in  the  award  of  charter  by  His  
Excellency (the late) President Mwai Kibaki. This effectively made KeMU a fully-
fledged university.  
In  the  years  after  the  award  of  charter,  the  University  has  continued  to  attract  the  
interest and support of various partners, both nationally and internationally.

1.2 Vision      
A   globally   competitive   Christian   University   producing   the   next   
generation of professionals and transformational leaders.
1.3      Mission
To  contribute  to  the  transformation  of  society  by  providing  high  
quality education that promotes excellence in scholarship, research and 
selfless service.
1.4 Philosophical Statement
To  develop  holistic  human  being  for  societal  development  guided  by  
Christian principles.

by  the  University  based  on  diverse  factors  including  but  not  limited  to:  reasons  
for the change, performance of the student within the current mode of study, fair 
assessment of the student’s ability to cope in the desired mode of study, among 
others. 
d) Pay a non-refundable application fee.
e) The following is a brief description of the various modes of study available. These 
are subject to change based on statutory or institutional definitions. It is also worth 
noting that it is possible to have overlaps between the various modes, where some 
courses  are  delivered  through  a  combination  of  face-to-face  and  online  sessions  
thus blended.
i) Full-time (FT)
The Full-time mode of study applies where a student attends scheduled regular 
day  classes  and  takes  the  full-time  load.  A  full-time  student  can  also  undertake  
parts of their courses through Online/e-learning mode.
ii) Part-time 
The part-time mode of study applies where a student attends scheduled regular 
evening, weekend or holiday classes and takes the standard load for this mode.
iii) Open and Distance Learning
The  Distance  Learning  Mode  (ODEL)  of  study  applies  where  a  student  is  
registered  for  course  work  but  does  not  attend  classes  and  takes  the  standard  
load for this mode. But a distance-learning student who wishes to attend some 
classes  with  the  full  time  students  will  be  required  to  apply  to  the  Registrar  
and,  if  approved,  pay  additional  fee  according  to  existing  rate.  Depending  on  
programme  requirements,  laboratory  experience  will  be  carried  out  at  external  
or  university  laboratories  at  extra  expense  to  the  students.  Students  are  guided  
through  various  courses  using  instructional  materials,  assignments,  continuous  
assessment, tutorials and examinations organized by the department.  
iv) Online
This is where a student takes all their studies entirely online, through the Learning 
Management System of the University, or through other internet-based systems 
prescribed by KeMU.

2.17 ICT Systems of the University 
The University employs diverse Information and Communication Technology (ICT) 
Systems  and  Tools  geared  towards  enhancing  the  learning  experience  of  a  student,  
among other functions. Some of the ICT Systems include:
a) Students Portal
This  is  the  portal  where  students  select  and  register  for  courses,  pay  fees,  view  their  
examination grades and academic progress, among others.
b) Learning Management System (Digital Campus)
This is the system used to host all learning activities from course materials, videos, live 
online classes, among others. It also allows students to interact with instructors online, 
discuss with other students, and review content at one’s own pace, among others.
c) General Requirements on ICT Systems/Readiness
To  make  the  most  out  of  the  ICT  Systems,  Apps,  Tools  and  Devices,  students  are  
required to:
i) Invest in their own Laptop and Smartphone.


ii) Use the official KeMU University Email Address at all times, including for 
accessing KeMU ICT systems and communications.
iii) Always create own Passwords to devices and systems.
iv) Read  and  understand  the  COMPUTER  MISUSE  AND  CYBERCRIMES ACT 
(No. 5 of  2018), an Act of Parliament guiding the use of ICT Systems.

3. ACADEMIC PROGRAMMES


3.0 ACADEMIC PROGRAMMES 
3.1 Academic Programmes
An  academic  programme  refers  to  the  design  of  learning  content  which  is  multi-
dimensional and includes intentions, structure of content, delivery methods, academic 
resources  and  delivery  modes,  as  accredited  by  CUE  and  other  regulatory  bodies.  
Academic  programmes are  developed  to  take  advantage  of  emerging  opportunities  
and address new challenges. The University offers academic Programmes leading to 
the award of certificates, diplomas and conferment of undergraduate and postgraduate 
degrees.

3.2 Programme of Study
A  Programme  of  study  means  a  prescribed  syllabus  that  student  must  be  taught  at  
each  key  stage.  It  describes  a  Semester-by-Semester  sequence  of  courses  a  student  is  
to undertake in a given academic programme in order to qualify for graduation. The 
programme of study is made up of a set of common courses, core courses, electives and 
Audit courses.

3.2.1 Common Courses
These are courses that are mandatory for all students as a graduation requirement. They 
are  general  courses  that  are  geared  to  provide  general  knowledge  and  values.  They  
are also meant to broaden the students’ scope of understanding in general university 
education  and  to  provide  a  foundation  for  further  professional  development.  They  
include at least one course in each of the following disciplines which shall be published 
from time to time:
a) Christianity
b) Languages and Communication
c) Humanities
d) Business and Economics
e) Mathematical Sciences
f) Computer Sciences
g) Natural Sciences
h) Health Sciences
i) Research and Ethics

3.2.2 Core Courses
These are courses that define the key knowledge/competency areas to be achieved by 
a programme of study. Core courses are defined during programme development, to 
ensure that the programme objectives are achieved. Core courses are mandatory for all 
students in a given programme of study.

3.2.3   Electives
Electives are courses that define additional areas of knowledge/competences that a 
student  in  a  given  programme  of  study  may  acquire.  A  student  is  required  to  take  
a  given  minimum  number  of  electives  from  a  recommended  list.  These  courses  are  
provided in programmes with different areas of specialization in order to allow students 
to  select  courses  aligned  to  their  areas  of  interest.  The  requirements  for  electives  are  
defined in each academic programme.

3.2.3 Audit/Optional Courses
To provide further education and learning opportunities to students, KeMU University 
allows students to take courses outside those prescribed in one’s Programme of Study. 
These  types  of  courses,  called  Audit/optional  courses,  are  optional  for  students  who  
wish to take extra courses out of their own interest. Audit courses can be taken from 
courses that are not mandatory within one’s programme, or from other programmes 
offered at the University. Audit courses are included in the computation of a student’s 
Semester Course Load to ensure that one does not overload themselves while taking an 
Audit course. Audit courses appear in the transcript of a student but are not used in the 
computation of the student’s GPA.


3.3 Academic Advisory
Students  are  assigned  academic  advisors  who  guide  them  in  matters  regarding  their  
studies. The advisors are professionals who are experienced instructors well versed in 
general matters of university education. The students are required to maintain regular 
contact with their advisors who will subsequently update the department and schools 
on students’ progression and performance

3.4 Change of Academic Programme
A student is enrolled into a specific programme of study at any given time. A student 
may apply to the Registrar Academic Affairs to change his/her programme of study.

obtainable from office of the Registrar, Academic Affairs. 
ii) Consequently,  only  the  relevant  courses  from  the  higher-level  programme  
shall be mapped to the lower-level programme.
iii) All other data relating to the higher-level programme shall be expunged.
iv) Pay a non-refundable application fee.

3.5 Duration of Study 
Duration  of  study  in  a  programme  is  the  total  academic  time,  evaluated  in  terms  of  
semesters, or academic years, required to satisfy the requirements of a specific academic 
programme  for  a  student  taking  the  standard  Semester  load.  The  duration  of  study  
varies  from  programme  to  programme.  The  following  is  a  summary  of  the  typical  
durations of study for the various levels of programmes:
a) Certificate courses have varying durations according to their specific designs.
b) A Diploma programme is expected to take a minimum of four (4) trimesters. The 
maximum period allowed is eight (8) trimesters for a full-time student and twelve 
(12) trimesters for a part-time or distance learning student.
c) A Bachelor’s degree is expected to take a minimum of nine (9) semesters for a full-
time, and twelve (10) trimesters for a student on part-time or distance learning mode. 
The  maximum  period  allowed  is  eighteen  (18)  semesters  for  a  full-time  student  
and twenty-four (24) semesters for a part-time or distance learning student.
d) A Master’s programme is expected to take a minimum of two (2) academic years 
(or 4 semesters) for a full-time student. This may vary depending on the mode of 
study.
e) A Doctorate  programme  is  expected  to  take  a  minimum  of  three  (3)  academic  
years  (or  6  semesters)  for  a  full-time  student.  This  may  vary  depending  on  the  
mode of study.


3.6 Failure to Complete a Programme
a) Registered  students  are  expected  to  complete  their  programmes  within  the  
stipulated durations of study.
b) A  student  who  is  unable  to  complete  their  programme  within  the  stipulated  
time or within a specific semester due to valid reasons is required to request for 
authorization to defer their studies.
c) A student who fails to defer their studies and fails to register for the expected units 
is considered to have abandoned their studies and may be required to reapply for 
admission.
d) The  maximum  allowable  duration  for  completion  of  studies  shall  not  be  more  
than  double  the  minimum  duration  prescribed  for  a  full-time  student  in  the  
programme.
e) A student who fails to complete their programme within the prescribed maximum 
duration will be eligible for discontinuation from the University and shall not be 
eligible for refund of any unutilized fees paid.
3.7 Extension of Period of study
An enrolled student who cannot complete a programme within the stipulated duration 
due  to  circumstances  beyond  his/her  control  must  inform  the  Registrar,  Academic  
Affairs in writing, and obtain official extension.

3.8 Course Loading
This is the number of credit hours that a student takes each Semester at KeMU.
a) Credit hour
KeMU  employs  a  credit  hour  system  in  determining  the  duration  in  a  programme.  
Courses are awarded credit hours defined as follows:
i) One credit hour is equivalent to 15 contact hours.
ii) One contact hour is equivalent to 50 minutes of  teaching time.
b) Credit hour for practical and laboratory time
Where teaching is Tutorial, Laboratory or Practicum, one credit hour will be defined 
as follows:
i) For  Tutorial  and/or  Laboratory:  One  Credit  hour  is  equivalent  to  up  to  30  
contact hours of student’s time, depending on the programme.
ii) For practicum: one credit hour is equivalent to up to 45 contact hours of student’s 
time depending on the programme.
c) Semester Course Loading by mode of  study
The  semester  course  loading for  each  student  is  determined  by  the  student  in  
consultation with the academic advisor, subject to the following specifications:
i) The standard load for Full-time students is 18 credit hours per Semester.
ii) The standard load for Part-time students is 15 credit hours per Semester.
iii) The standard load for students on Distance Learning and Online Modes is 15 
credits hours per Semester.
iv) Research projects, seminars and practicum/internship/field attachment are 
part of a Semester’s (session’s) standard loading.
The maximum  allowable  is 21 credit hours for fulltime mode. This  is  subject  to  
recommendation  by  the  Chairman  of  the  Programme  Department,  and  approval  by  
the Dean of Faculty, on condition that the applicant’s cumulative GPA  is  3.50  and  
above. A fee will be charged for any extra hour above the standard load.

3.9 Determining the Year of Study
The year of study is thus determined by the sum of credit hours transferred from other 
institutions and the credit hours successfully completed at KeMU, irrespective of the 
calendar  duration  of  stay  at  the  University.  In  general,  two  semesters  successfully  
completed by a full-time student is approximately equal to one year of study. Years of 
study of an undergraduate student are determined as follows:


Year of studyCredits earned at KeMU + Credits Transferred
First Year0 – 36 (Equivalent to two (2) trimesters of study)
Second Year37 – 73 (Equivalent to four( 4) trimesters of study)
Third Year74 – 110 (Equivalent to six (6) trimesters of study)
Fourth Year111 and over (Equivalent to eight (8) trimesters of study)

5. EXAMINATIONS & GRADING SYSTEM
5.0 EXAMINATIONS AND GRADING SYSTEM

5.1 Grading system
a) KeMU uses the Grade Point Average (GPA) system. A GPA is a number between 
0 and 4 inclusive. 
b) A cumulative grade point average is calculated as an indicator of overall academic 
performance in a programme and is used as a criterion for academic progression, 
graduation requirements, for awards and other academic distinctions.
c) Each course is assessed based on the Continuous Assessment Tests (30% or 50% 
or  otherwise)  and  the  Semester  Examinations  (50%  or  70%  or  otherwise)  and  
given a letter grade, A- E and/or Pass/Fail. 
5.1.1 Letter Grades and their Numerical Values
a) The  letter  grades  with  their  corresponding  numerical  values,  form  an  eight-step  
grade point scale as shown below for Undergraduate:
Letter GradeRange of MarksPOINTS
A75 – 100%4.0
B+68 – 74%3.5
B60 – 67%3.0
C+55 – 59%2.5
C50 – 54%2.0
D+45 – 49%1.5
D40 – 44%1.0
E0 - 39%0.0
For Postgraduate a four-step grade point scale is used as shown below:
Letter GradeRange of MarksPOINTS
A70 – 100%4.0
B60 – 69%3.0
C50 – 59%2.0
EBelow 50%0.0
b) The letter grades having no corresponding numerical values are the following:
i) Pass = Passed course on Pass/Fail no credit basis = No value
ii) Fail = Failed course on Pass/Fail no credit basis = No value
iii) W = Withdrawn course = No value
iv) I = Incomplete course 
v) TC = Credit Transfer
vi) CE= Credit Exemption
vii) • = Repeated
viii) T= Audited Course = No Value
c) W refers to a course, which meets the following criteria;
i) A course withdrawn after the third week of a Semester.
ii) A course has no CAs and Exam Mark.
iii) A course with Exam Mark and no CAs Mark.
iv) Students are supposed to re-register afresh for withdrawn course unless it was 
officially approved.
d) I  refers  to  a  grade  for  a  course  in  which  a  student  has  completed  course  work  
requirements (CAs), but fails to sit for the exam for one reason or another. The 
student  is  supposed  to  sit  for  special  or  missed  exam  within  one  academic  year,  
otherwise the student will be required to repeat the course.

5.1.2 Computation of the Grade Point Average (GPA)
The GPA is computed as follows:
a) Multiply  the  credit  hours  of  each  course  taken  during  the  trimester  by  the  corresponding point value of the letter grade obtained.
b) Sum up all these products to get the trimester points. 
c) Sum up the credit hours of all the courses taken during the trimester. This sum is 
called trimester credit hours. 
d) Divide trimester points by trimester credit hours. The resulting number is the GPA of 
the student for that particular trimester.
e) Cumulative  GPA  of  a  student  for  a  certain  number  of  trimesters  is  computed  in  
the  same  way  as  for  the  Semester  GPA,  except  that  in  the  case  of  cumulative
